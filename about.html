    <u><h2>My self</h2></u>
    <p>
        My name is Md.Shoriful islam and am male. I am 32 years old, married with one kid. I was born in a small village where I grew up. After high school, I joined Sonargonj University a famous university in Bangladesh where I studied Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing. <br><br>

I was employed in 2009 until 2019 when I quit to become a freelancer. <br><br>




 
I am a go getter and don’t let anything come in my way. If I set my mind toward achieving something I push it until I have my goals. I like taking risks and when I quit my job as an ICT officer to become a freelancer, many people thought I had lost my mind. The reason I quit my job is because it wasn’t challenging enough, I used to do the same thing day in day out which became too boring for me. I enjoy freelancing and don’t regret quitting my job. <br><br>

I am married to one of the most adorable women I have ever met in my life and have one kid, a boy. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me. He is almost four months now and I have enjoyed every step of bringing his up. He is one of the reasons I decided to quit my job and become a work at home father. I wouldn’t want to spend a day away from his; he is the light of my life <br><br>




 
I love life and always take time from my busy schedule to make sure I enjoy what nature has to offer. I love sightseeing and if not working or taking care of my baby, I am out enjoying fresh air and enjoying the scenery. <br><br>

I enjoy spending time with my family and friends as I think that family is the most important unit that helps us keep sane. As a family we enjoy praying together, visiting relatives and keeping each other company. The family is where you get listened to and get valuable advice. <br><br>

I am fun to be around though it takes time before am able to open up to anyone. I enjoy life and all the things life has to offer.
